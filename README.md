### Frimware
The firmware project is based on Arduino IDE 1.8
### Hardware
The hardware was created using the KiCAD layout tool.
### Housing
The housing was designed using FreeCAD 0.18. 
Export of STL models was done with custom FreeCAD macros, which can be found at the following [link](https://github.com/robertkrahl/FreeCAD/tree/master/macros).
The 3D printed prototype was created using the original Prusa i3 MK3S printer and Prusa Slicer software.
